Function Mumbo-Jumbo

Define a function factorial() with one input n. [The default value of n needs to be 5]. Use the factorial() function and other inbuilt functions to find the maximum between the following:
1. 5!+3!-21 and 2!+4!+12
2. 26!+31! and 22!+35!
3. 21!+34!-15! and 31!+27!-19!

Hint: you can use the min() and max() inbuilt functions of python.


Fibonacci

There is a sequence of numbers called the fibonacci numbers where each number can be calculated as the sum of the last 2 numbers before it.

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,....

In the above sequence you can see that the fourth number 2 is the sum of the second and third number 1 and 1. The fifth number 3 is the sum of 2 (fourth number) and 1 (third number) and so on.

Write a function fibonacci(n) which returns the nth fibonacci number. This should be calcuated using the while loop. The default value of n should be 10.

fibonacci(1)
>>>0
fibonacci(2)
>>>1
fibonacci(3)
>>>1
fibonacci(4)
>>>2
fibonacci(5)
>>>3

Also find the maximum of:
fibonacci(12)+fibonacci(10) and fibonacci(11)+fibonacci(11).
