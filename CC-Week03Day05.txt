a. Define a function arithmetic_operation() which takes 2 numbers and operation name as input and performs an operation on them:
* opname: "Add" - Then we add 2 numbers
* opname: "Sub" - Then we subtract 2 numbers
* opname: "Multiply" - Then we multiply 2 numbers
* opname: "Divide" - Then we divide the 2 numbers

Print the result of the operation and also return it.

b. Redefine the same function with default values for numbers as 3 and 5 and opname as "Add". Use the same function to calculate 5+3-12+23
